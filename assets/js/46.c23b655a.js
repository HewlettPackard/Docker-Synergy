Depending on the environment, you may need to create one or more SPTs depending on the type of servers available in your Synergy environment. In the simplest case, where all servers are of the same Server Hardware Type and there is a single enclosure group, a single SPT can be used. If, on the other hand, the pool of compute modules consists of different server types (for example Gen9 and Gen10 compute modules), then a separate SPT must be created for each Server Hardware Type. When creating the SPT, an OSDP is specified. In most cases, the same OSDP can be used for all compute modules running the same operating system.  If you want to deploy both Windows and Linux worker nodes in the same cluster, you need to create a minimum of two SPTs and two OSDPs.
