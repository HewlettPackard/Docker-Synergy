# HPE Synergy configuration

The Ansible playbooks are available to download at [https://github.com/HewlettPackard/Docker-Synergy](https://github.com/HewlettPackard/Docker-Synergy). By default, the playbooks are configured as shown in Figure 2 to set up a 3 node environment. This is the minimal starter configuration recommended by HPE and Docker for production.

The playbooks can also be used for larger container environments, for example, with a 3 frame, 6 node HPE Synergy system, as shown in Figure 3 with 2 nodes in each frame.
