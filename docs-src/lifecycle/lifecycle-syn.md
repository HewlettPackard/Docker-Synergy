# HPE Synergy environment

HPE Synergy Composer powered by HPE OneView provides fast, reliable, and simplified firmware and 
driver management across many HPE Synergy components. HPE OneView manages firmware to reduce manual 
interactions and errors, in addition to minimizing downtime. Firmware updates of management appliances 
and shared infrastructure are non-disruptive to the production workload.
